"""Process-wide registry of active LCM runtime clones by session/lane.

Isolated from ``engine.py`` (WS5 seam): LCM clones register their own
session/conversation binding so post-turn ingest can follow the active clone
instead of the process-wide plugin singleton. The lock and the two weak
registries live here alongside the pure resolver/matcher helpers that read
them. ``engine.py`` imports the shared lock, the two registries, the removal
helper, and the public ``resolve_active_lcm_engine`` entry point; the binding
methods on ``LCMEngine`` mutate the same shared objects by reference.
